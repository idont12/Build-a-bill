  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project was developed in just three weeks during the summer of 2022. Inspired by the <strong>Gravity Falls</strong> TV show (specifically Bill Cipherâ€™s first appearance in Season 1, Episode 19), the goal was to enable fans of the show to recreate and customize their own cool animation effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website was programmed and designed entirely by me, with a focus on creating an intuitive and simple user experience.
